<h1>Important! Please Read</h1>

<p>
This page is the default menu of databases. The URLs here DO NOT necessarily reflect the URLs you will
use on your e-resources page. To test your URLs, DO NOT use the links below.
Instead, please prepend your proxy prefix to the link you want to test and test
directly in your browser. So if you
are testing:
</p>
<p>
<code>http://www.somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.htm</code>
</p>
<p> prepend your proxy prefix:</p>
<code>^{server:url:http}/login?url=</code><br />
(note: you can also use https. Either way, your users will be directed to a secure link for login.)

</p>
<p>to get:</p>
<p>
<code>
^{server:url:http}/login?url=http://www.somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.htm
</code>
</p>

<p>
Cut and paste this link directly into your browser to test it.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>This is how you will build the links for your e-resources
page. It is recommended for testing that you build an entire page of the links you want
to test, as you may need to test several times, or with several people (preferably both.)
</p>

<p>
While the use of this menu page is strongly discouraged in your hosted EZproxy production
environment, we can make exceptions if you are unable to host your own menu page. However,
in this case, you will need to provide us with the html for the menu page you wish to use, 
including static links to all of your proxied resources.
We do not support the use of the automatically generated menu page.
