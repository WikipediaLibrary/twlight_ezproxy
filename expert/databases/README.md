# DO NOT UPLOAD TO HOSTED EZPROXY.

Here for compatibility with hosted EZproxy include files.
OCLC maintains a list of [predefined Database stanzas](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas) which it updates over time.
Many of these stanzas are available as include files in the hosted environment.
If you add a reference to a hosted include file in [ezproxy.cfg](../ezproxy.cfg), you must add a corresponding empty file to this directory to allow a local ezproxy instance to start.
